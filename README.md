This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
# Dev Test

## Exercise

Create a basic web application using next.js + React to display a login page. The login page should include fields for email and password. The page doesn't need to have actual functionality, but it should have the following feature:

- When the user enters a value that is not a valid email address in the email field, the box should have a red border and display a notification informing the user that the entered value is not a valid email.

You have the freedom to choose any component library you prefer.

Additionally, please include a Dockerfile that enables us to run the next application easily by running the Docker container.

# Other notes

While we are not monitoring the time, the exercise should take you less than an hour to complete. Consider things like code quality, proper git usage (such a granular commits, meaningful commit messages etc.), ease of use etc.
